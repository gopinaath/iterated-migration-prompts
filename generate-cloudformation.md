Don't create AWS services or configurations manually.  Always do it using cloudformation; when it's not possible, ask me.  The criteria for success is when the cloudformation deploy script is invoked and the entire 
  stack deploys and the application works as tested using puppeteer.  Please continue to fix the issues and iterate.
