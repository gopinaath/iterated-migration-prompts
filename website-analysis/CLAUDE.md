I have a set of businesses and their corresponding webpages(URLs).  I'm trying to analyze the content of these web pages.  Output the results in ANALYSIS.md as table.  The columns in the table are : Given URL, business name, and the specific analysis result that was requested.  Add suitable column name for the type of analysis needed.

IMPORTANT:  The analysis result needs to be 100% accurate.  If you are unable to determine accurately, say so and give a brief reason why it could not be determined.   Validate if the analysis is accurate using puppeteer. Do this slowly, so that it doesn't overload the server or affect the website performance.
